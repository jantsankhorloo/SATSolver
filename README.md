Boolean Satisfiability Problem 

Main.java takes inputs one by one and it is an earlier version of the program.

Test.java takes multiple inputs at the same time and gives output once it reaches EOF.

To run and test the program, run these in your terminal:

javac “MyJavaFile1.java” 
java “NameOfMyMainClass” < final_input.txt > output.txt
